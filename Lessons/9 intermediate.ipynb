    "# 9. Introduction to Web Structure: HTML & CSS\n",
    "\n",
    "While Python handles logic and data processing, the visual presentation of data on the web is managed by HTML and CSS. Understanding their basics is crucial for anyone working with web applications, data scraping, or even just creating a simple portfolio page to showcase projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of **HTML (`HyperText Markup Language`)** as the architectural **blueprint** that defines the structure and content of a web page. **CSS (`Cascading Style Sheets`)** is the **interior design** – it controls the appearance, layout, color, and fonts.\n",
    "\n",
    "An HTML document marks up content using paired **tags**: `<tag_name>content</tag_name>`.\n",
    "- Tags define what each **element** is (e.g., `<head>`, `<body>`, `<h1>` for a main heading, `<p>` for a paragraph, `<img>` for an image).\n",
    "- Some tags have **attributes** that provide additional information, like `href` for a link's destination or `src` for an image source.\n",
    "\n",
    "**HTML Document Structure:**\n",
    "- The entire document is wrapped in an `<html>` tag, telling the browser it's an HTML document.\n",
    "- The `<head>` section contains meta-information for the browser: the page's title (for the browser tab), description and keywords for search engines, links to CSS stylesheets, etc. This is like the document's manifest or ID card.\n",
    "- The `<body>` section contains all the visible content of the page: headings, text, images, links, etc. This is the main content of your report or log.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creating an HTML Document:**\n",
    "- In your code editor, create a new file and save it with an `.html` extension (e.g., `my_portfolio.html`).\n",
    "- To quickly generate a basic HTML template in many editors (like VS Code):\n",
    "    - In your empty `.html` file, type an exclamation mark `!` and press `ENTER`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Below is an example of a simple HTML document."
