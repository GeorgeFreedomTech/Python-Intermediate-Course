    "The recommended way to work with files is using the `with open(...)` statement.\n",
    "This approach ensures the file is automatically closed after use, even if errors occur.\n",
    "Key parameters for `open()`:\n",
    "- `mode`: A string specifying the access rights. Common modes:\n",
    "    - `\"r\"`: **read** - Opens an existing file for reading (default mode).\n",
    "    - `\"w\"`: **write** - Creates a new file (or overwrites an existing one) for writing.\n",
    "    - `\"a\"`: **append** - Opens a file to add new content to the end of it.\n",
    "- `encoding=\"utf-8\"`: Specifies the character encoding. UTF-8 is a universal standard and is the default in Python 3, making this parameter often optional but good practice to include.\n",
    "- The file is opened using an `as` alias (e.g., `as log_file:`)."

    "                         # (In Windows, `cd` with no path often does this).\n",

    "- `mv old.txt new.txt`       # (Linux/macOS - Move) Also used for renaming.\n",
