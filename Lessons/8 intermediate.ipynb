    "# 8. Python Environments: Global vs. Virtual Workspaces\n",
    "\n",
    "To make our Python programs truly powerful, we often need them to interact with the world outside the script itself. This involves working with the computer's file system and the Python runtime environment. For managing project dependencies and tools effectively, understanding Python environments is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The global Python environment.\n",
    "- Local (virtual) environments for installing external modules."

    "## 8.1. Global and Local (Virtual) Environments: Your Digital Workshop\n",
    "Python comes with many \"built-in\" modules (like `datetime` or `random`) that are always available for import.\n",
    "However, for more specialized tasks, you'll need to install external modules/libraries using `pip` (Python's package installer).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can install packages in two main ways:\n",
    "- **Globally**: Using `pip install package_name` in your terminal installs the package into your main Python installation. This is like putting a new, large machine in the middle of your main workshop, where it's shared by all projects.\n",
    "- **Locally (into a Virtual Environment)**: This creates an isolated, self-contained \"lab\" or \"workspace\" for a specific project. All packages you install are contained only within this environment, separate from your global setup and other projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "RECOMMENDATION:\n",
    "- Keep your global Python installation clean with only core packages.\n",
    "- For **every new project, create its own dedicated virtual environment**. This prevents conflicts where one project needs an old version of a library and another project needs a new version. It's like having a clean, organized lab for each unique mission, with a specific set of tools."

    "## 8.2. Mission Setup: Creating and Managing Virtual Environments\n",
    "For more details, see official documentation like VS Code's guide on Python environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### I. Creating a Virtual Environment:\n",
    "1. Open your system's terminal (e.g., Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal on Linux/macOS).\n",
    "2. Navigate to the folder where you want to create your project.\n",
    "3. Run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `python -m venv my_project_env`\n",
    "- This creates a new folder named 'my_project_env' containing a clean Python installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### II. Activating the Virtual Environment:\n",
    "Before you can use it, you must \"activate\" the environment.\n",
    "The activation command differs by OS:\n",
    "\n",
    "- On Windows (in Command Prompt or PowerShell, from your project folder):\n",
    "`my_project_env\\Scripts\\activate`\n",
    "\n",
    "- On Linux / macOS (from your project folder):\n",
    "`source my_project_env/bin/activate`\n",
    "\n",
    "After activation, your terminal prompt will typically change to show the environment's name, e.g.:\n",
    "- (my_project_env) C:\\Users\\YourUser\\Projects\\MyProject>\n",
    "- Note: On Windows, you may need to adjust your script execution policy to run the activate script.\n",
    "\n",
    "### III. Installing/Uninstalling Modules in the Active Environment:\n",
    "With the environment active, use `pip` as usual.\n",
    "Packages will now be installed only inside this environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `pip install package_name`\n",
    "- `pip uninstall package_name`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### IV. Deactivating the Virtual Environment:\n",
    "When you're done working, you can deactivate it.\n",
    "- `deactivate`\n",
    "Your terminal prompt will return to normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### V. Listing Installed Packages:\n",
    "This command shows the packages installed in the currently active environment.\n",
    "If no environment is active, it shows your globally installed packages.\n",
    "- `pip list`\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8.3. Python Interpreter & Using Virtual Environments\n",
    "Each virtual environment contains its own Python interpreter and its own set of installed packages (`pip`).\n",
    "Your code editor or IDE (like VS Code) needs to be told which Python interpreter to use for your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "By selecting the interpreter from your virtual environment, you gain access to all the packages installed within it.\n",
    "There are two common ways to do this in VS Code:\n",
    "1. Click on the Python version shown in the bottom-right corner of the status bar and select a different interpreter from the list. Choose the one located inside your virtual environment folder.\n",
    "2. Use the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and search for `Python: Select Interpreter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alternatively, you can run your script from the terminal *after* activating the virtual environment.\n",
    "Navigate to your script's folder in the activated terminal and run it:\n",
    "- `python your_script_name.py`"

    "## practice\n",
    "\n",
    "This practice is a hands-on tutorial to be performed in your computer's **terminal** (like Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal on macOS/Linux) and your **code editor** (e.g., VS Code).\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Check Global Packages:** Open your terminal and run `pip list` to see what packages are installed in your main (\"global\") Python environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Create a Virtual Environment:** In a folder for your projects (e.g., on your Desktop), run the command to create a new virtual environment. Let's call it `converter_env`.\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    python -m venv converter_env\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3.  **Activate It:** Activate your new `converter_env`. Your terminal prompt should now show `(converter_env)` at the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Install a Package:** While the environment is active, install a simple, third-party library called `tempconvert` using pip:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    pip install tempconvert\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "5.  **Check Local Packages:** Run `pip list` again. You should now see `tempconvert` and its dependencies listed. These packages are installed locally in your `converter_env` only.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Verify the Installation:**\n",
    "    - In your code editor (like VS Code), create a new Python file (e.g., `test_converter.py`).\n",
    "    - **Select the Interpreter:** In VS Code, click the Python version in the bottom-right corner or use `Ctrl+Shift+P` -> `Python: Select Interpreter`. Choose the Python interpreter from your `converter_env` folder (e.g., `.../converter_env/Scripts/python.exe`).\n",
    "    - Add the following code to your file and run it. If it runs without import errors and prints the results, your environment is working correctly.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    from tempconvert import celsius_to_fahrenheit, fahrenheit_to_celsius, celsius_to_kelvin, kelvin_to_celsius\n",
    "\n",
    "    # use these functions to convert temperatures:\n",
    "    print(f\"0°C is {celsius_to_fahrenheit(0)}°F\")\n",
    "    print(f\"32°F is {fahrenheit_to_celsius(32)}°C\")\n",
    "    print(f\"0°C is {celsius_to_kelvin(0)} K\")\n",
    "    print(f\"273.15 K is {kelvin_to_celsius(273.15)}°C\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "7.  **(Optional)** Try uninstalling the package from your active environment: `pip uninstall tempconvert`.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.  **Deactivate:** When you are done working, deactivate the environment in your terminal:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    deactivate\n",
    "    ```"
