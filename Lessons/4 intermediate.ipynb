    "# 4. Code Refactoring: Refining Your Procedures\n",
    "\n",
    "Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code without changing its external behavior. It's a critical skill for improving the design, readability, and maintainability of your code after you've made it work. Think of it as reviewing and improving your code after it's already working.\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"Improving\" your code for clarity and efficiency.\n",
    "- Aiming for simpler, cleaner code.\n",
    "- Enhancing readability and maintainability.\n",
    "- Often involves applying concepts like comprehensions, type hinting, docstrings, and improved logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.1. The Refactoring Mindset: From Working Route to Optimal Path\n",
    "- **1. Solve the problem:** First, write code that works and correctly produces the desired result. Just get from point A to point B.\n",
    "- **2. Seek better solutions:** After it works, look for ways to improve it. Can the code be made clearer, shorter, or more efficient?\n",
    "- **3. Revisit and improve:** As you learn new techniques, it's excellent practice to return to your older code and see if you can refactor it with your new skills, better tools and knowledge."
