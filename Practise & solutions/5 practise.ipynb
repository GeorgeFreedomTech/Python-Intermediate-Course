    "**Scenario:** You are an operative managing field reports and data logs for your missions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Create and Write to a File:**\n",
    "    - Write a program that creates a new text file named `mission_report.txt`.\n",
    "    - Write 5 distinct lines of text into this file (e.g., status updates like \"System Check: OK\", \"Sector Scan: Complete\", \"Anomaly Detected: Yes\", \"Power Level: 85%\", \"Next Objective: Waypoint Delta\").\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Read from a File:**\n",
    "    - Write a program that opens the `mission_report.txt` file you created in the previous step.\n",
    "    - Read the entire content of the file and print it to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Append to an Existing File:**\n",
    "    - Write a program that opens `mission_report.txt` in a mode that allows adding content without deleting the existing data.\n",
    "    - Add 2 new lines of text to the end of the file.\n",
    "    - To verify, open and print the file's entire content again to show that the new lines have been added at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Modify an Existing Line in a File:**\n",
    "    - Write a program that:\n",
    "        - Reads all lines from `mission_report.txt`.\n",
    "        - Modifies a specific line in that list (e.g., find the line containing \"Power Level\" and change its value).\n",
    "        - Print the final (modified) content to verify the change was made.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge I: Operative Manifest System using Files**\n",
    "- Create an empty file named `operative_manifest.txt`.\n",
    "- In a new Python file (`main.py`):\n",
    "    - **a) Write a function `register_new_operative()`:**\n",
    "        - This function should prompt for an operative's `name`, `assigned_sector`, and `contact_frequency`.\n",
    "        - It should `return` this data as a dictionary.\n",
    "    - **b) Write a function `log_operative(operative_data_dict, file_path)`:**\n",
    "        - This function takes a dictionary (from the previous function) and a file path as arguments.\n",
    "        - It should **append** the operative's dictionary (converted to a string) as a new line in the specified file.\n",
    "    - **c) Write a function `find_operative(operative_name, file_path)`:**\n",
    "        - This function takes a name to search for and a file path.\n",
    "        - It should open and read the manifest file line by line.\n",
    "        - If it finds a line containing the `operative_name`, it should print `\"Operative Found.\"` and stop searching.\n",
    "        - If it searches the whole file and doesn't find the name, it should print `\"Operative not found in manifest.\"`\n",
    "- In your `main.py`'s main logic block, use these functions to add at least 3 new operatives to the manifest and then test your `find_operative()` function (test for a name that exists and one that doesn't).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge II: Refactor the Manifest System**\n",
    "- Take your solution from Challenge I and refactor it:\n",
    "    - Add **Type Hints** and **Docstrings** to all your functions.\n",
    "    - Add **Error Handling** (`try-except`) for file operations (e.g., `FileNotFoundError` when trying to read) and for user input conversion if necessary.\n",
    "    - **Modularize your code:**\n",
    "        - Keep the main logic (user interaction, calling functions) in `main.py`.\n",
    "        - Move your function definitions (`register_new_operative`, `log_operative_to_manifest`, `find_operative_in_manifest`) into a separate file named `manifest_operations.py`.\n",
    "        - From `main.py`, import the functions you need from `manifest_operations.py`."
