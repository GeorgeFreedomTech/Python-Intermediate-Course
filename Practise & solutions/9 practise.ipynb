    "Your Own Explorer's Portfolio Page - Project Setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new folder for your HTML project (e.g., my-portfolio-site).\n",
    "In your code editor, create a new HTML file inside that folder. A standard name for the main page is index.html.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Populate the `head` Section:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Fill in the description, keywords, and author meta tags with your own information.\n",
    "    - Give your page a suitable `title`, e.g., \"John Doe's Exploration Portfolio\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- Build the `body` Content:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Create one main heading `h1` and two sub-headings `h2`. For example: `Mission Logs`, with sub-headings `Sector Alpha Survey` and `Artifact Analysis`.\n",
    "    - Add at least one paragraph of text under each sub-heading, describing the topic.\n",
    "    - Add a link to an external website relevant to your hobby or interests (e.g., a link to a NASA page or a favorite blog).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Insert two images:\n",
    "        - One from a local file in your project folder (e.g., a profile picture or a project logo).\n",
    "        - One from an external URL on the internet (e.g., an image of a galaxy from a space agency website).\n",
    "        - Use the height or width attribute on your images to resize them to a maximum of 500 pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a Navigation Menu:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Create at least two more HTML pages, e.g., gallery.html and contact.html in your project folder.\n",
    "    - Add some basic content to the `body` of these new pages.\n",
    "    - On all three of your pages (index.html, gallery.html, contact.html), add an unordered list `ul` to act as a simple navigation menu.\n",
    "    - Inside the list, use list items `li` containing links that point to your other pages. This will allow you to navigate between the pages of your site."
