    "    - `\"r\"`: **read** - Opens an existing file for reading (default mode).\n",

    "    - `\"a\"`: **append** - Opens a file to add new content to the end of it.\n",
    "- `encoding=\"utf-8\"`: Specifies the character encoding. UTF-8 is a universal standard and is the default in Python 3, making this parameter often optional but good practice to include.\n",
