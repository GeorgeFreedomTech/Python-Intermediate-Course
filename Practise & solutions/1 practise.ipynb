    "**Scenario:** You are managing funds for an extended deep-space exploration mission.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Initial Setup:**\n",
    "    - Prompt the explorer (user) to input the following on a single line using **multiple assignment**:\n",
    "        - `current_funds` (initial amount).\n",
    "        - `monthly_income` (amount to be set aside or spent each month).\n",
    "        - `mission_duration` (total number of months for this phase).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Budget Simulation:**\n",
    "    - Using a loop that runs for `mission_duration`:\n",
    "        - In each month, apply the `monthly_income` to the `current_funds` using an appropriate **augmented assignment operator** \n",
    "        \n",
    "3.  **Report Results:**\n",
    "    - After the loop, print:\n",
    "        - The expedition funds after the specified period.\n",
    "        - The total amount added through monthly allocations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Challenge:**\n",
    "    - Modify the program:\n",
    "        - Allow the `monthly_income` to be a *different amount entered by the user each month* inside the loop.\n",
    "        - After adding the monthly allocation, apply a monthly 'investment return' or 'resource appreciation' to the `current_funds` (e.g., increase by 1.5% of the current balance). Print information about this appreciation each month."
