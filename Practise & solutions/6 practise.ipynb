    "**1. The `time` Module:**\n",
    "- **a) Synchronization Check:** Write a script that:\n",
    "    - Prints the current time in a human-readable format.\n",
    "    - Pauses execution for 2 seconds.\n",
    "    - After the pause, prints the current time again in the same format.\n",
    "    - Make the program perform this \"print-pause-print\" sequence 5 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **b) Performance Measurement:** Write a script that measures how long a demanding operation takes to complete.\n",
    "    - In the beginning it announces \"Operation starting...\"\n",
    "    - Perform a computationally heavy task (e.g., a loop that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 1,000,000).\n",
    "    - After the operation is complete, announce \"Operation finished.\"\n",
    "    - Calculate and print the total duration.\n",

    "**2. The `calendar` Module:**\n",
    "- **a) Weekend Day Counter:** Write a script that:\n",
    "    - Asks the user to input a year and a month number.\n",
    "    - Calculates and returns the number of weekend days (Saturdays and Sundays) in that specific month and year.\n",
    "    - *Example Output:* `In February 2024, there are 8 weekend days.`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. The `datetime` Module:**\n",
    "- Write scripts to perform the following timeline calculations:\n",
    "    - **a)** Get and display the current date and time.\n",
    "    - **b)** Create a `datetime` object for a mission start date: January 1, 1935.\n",
    "    - **c)** Determine which day of the week a specific future event falls on (e.g., May 14, 2041 or use input) and then convert and print this date as a string in the format \"YYYY-MM-DD\".\n",
    "    - **d)** Calculate the time interval (e.g., the number of days) between the current date and a final mission rendezvous date of September 18, 2055."
