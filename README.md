## 🎯 Learning Objectives / New Treasures to Uncover:

Upon completing this expedition, you will be able to:

* Write more concise and efficient "Pythonic" code using comprehensions and advanced functions.
* Structure a project into multiple modules and manage dependencies in a virtual environment.
* Interact with your computer's file system to read, write, and manage files programmatically.
* Retrieve and parse data from websites and APIs using standard Python libraries.
* Apply principles of good code design, documentation, and refactoring.
  
## 🎒 Course Prerequisites / Advanced Gear-Up:

* A solid understanding of Python fundamentals (variables, data types, lists, dictionaries, loops, basic functions) as covered in the Python Foundations course or equivalent experience.
* A working Python installation.
* Comfort with using the terminal/command line for basic commands.

## 🧭 How to Get and Run Course Materials:

Here is a guide on how to download the Jupyter Notebooks (**.ipynb files**) and how to open them. You can choose to work locally (on your computer) or online.

### Part 1: How to Download the Materials

#### Option A: Download as ZIP (Easiest for Beginners)
* Go to the main page of this repository on GitHub.
* Click the green Code button.
* Select **Download ZIP**.
Important: Extract (unzip) the downloaded folder to a location on your computer (e.g., Documents/PythonCourse). Do not try to run files directly inside the ZIP archive.

#### Option B: Git Clone (For Advanced Users)
If you are comfortable with the terminal and want to easily update materials later:
* Open your terminal or command prompt.
* Run the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GeorgeFreedomTech/python-intermediate-course.git
    ```
### Part 2: How to Open and Run the Notebooks
#### Option 1: VS Code (Recommended - Offline)
This is the best way to work if you want to keep everything on your own computer.

**Prerequisites:**
* VS Code installed.
* Python installed.
* Jupyter Extension for VS Code installed (search for "Jupyter" by Microsoft in the Extensions marketplace).

**Steps:**
* Open VS Code.
* Go to File > Open Folder... and select the folder you downloaded/cloned.
* Click on any file ending in **.ipynb**.
* In the top-right corner, click Select Kernel and choose your Python version (or venv).
* You can now run the code cells by clicking the "Play" button next to them.

#### Option 2: Google Colab (Alternative - Online)
If you cannot install Python locally or want to try the code quickly in your browser.

**Prerequisites:**
* You have to have a Google account
  
**Steps:**
* Go to **colab.research.google.com**.
* Log in with your **Google Account**.
* Select the **GitHub tab** in the pop-up window.
* Paste the URL of this repository and search.
* Click on the notebook you want to open.
* **Alternatively:** You can go to the Upload tab and upload the **.ipynb file** you downloaded in Part 1.
