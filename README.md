## üéØ Learning Objectives / New Treasures to Uncover:

Upon completing this expedition, you will be able to:

* Write more concise and efficient "Pythonic" code using comprehensions and advanced functions.
* Structure a project into multiple modules and manage dependencies in a virtual environment.
* Interact with your computer's file system to read, write, and manage files programmatically.
* Retrieve and parse data from websites and APIs using standard Python libraries.
* Apply principles of good code design, documentation, and refactoring.
  
## üéí Prerequisites / Advanced Gear-Up:

* A solid understanding of Python fundamentals (variables, data types, lists, dictionaries, loops, basic functions) as covered in the Python Foundations course or equivalent experience.
* A working Python installation.
* Comfort with using the terminal/command line for basic commands.

## üß≠ How to Use These Materials:
  
The lessons are provided as Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) files. To use them:

0. **Online:** Download the Jupyter files and go on: https://jupyter.org/try .. and upload&open the files there

-- OR--

1.  **Clone or Download:** Get a copy of this repository onto your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GeorgeFreedomTech/python-foundations-course.git
    ```
2.  **Ensure Jupyter is Installed:** You'll need Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
    * The common way is to install the Anaconda Distribution (which includes Jupyter).
    * Alternatively, install it via pip:
        ```bash
        pip install notebook
        # or for JupyterLab
        pip install jupyterlab
        ```
3.  **Launch Jupyter:** Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you cloned/downloaded the files, and run:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    or for JupyterLab:
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```
4.  **Explore:** Your browser should open the Jupyter interface. Navigate to the lesson files and open them to start your learning expedition! Each lesson notebook contains explanations, code examples, and exercises. A corresponding "Solutions" notebook is provided for the exercises.

## üí° Purpose of This Repository:

* **Educational Resource:** A practical, hands-on guide for advancing your Python skills.
* **Professional Portfolio:** Demonstrating my teaching methodology for intermediate concepts.
* **Content Foundation:** A source of examples for articles, tutorials, and social media.
